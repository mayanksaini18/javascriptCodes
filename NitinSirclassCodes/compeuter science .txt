CD (Compiler Design) – Translating high-level code to machine code

💻 Hardware (H/W)
Deals with the physical and low-level logical components of the computer system.

DLD (Digital Logic Design) – Circuits, gates, flip-flops, and basic digital electronics

COA (Computer Organization & Architecture) – Structure and behavior of the actual computer hardware

⚙️ System-Level Subjects
These manage system operations, communication, and data organization internally.

OS (Operating System) – Process, memory, file, and resource management

CN (Computer Networks) – Data transmission, protocols, networking layers

DBMS (Database Management System) – Organizing, storing, retrieving, and managing data

🧠 Logic-Based/Problem-Solving Subjects
