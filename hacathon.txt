I just wrapped up an amazing experience  at IIIT Bangalore,

It wasnâ€™t just about crypto or AI â€” it was about meeting curious minds, sharing ideas, and seeing how technology can actually make our daily lives easier. The energy in the room, the conversations, and the passion everyone brought to the table made it an unforgettable day.

The biggest takeaway for me?
ðŸ’¡ Innovation isnâ€™t just about building cool things â€” itâ€™s about making them simple, useful, and accessible to everyone.
